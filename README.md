# Python Mini Projects 🚀

This repository is a collection of **small Python projects** that I created while learning and practicing programming.  
Each script demonstrates core Python concepts, problem-solving, and working with libraries in a fun and practical way.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1. Calculator.py
A simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

👉 *Learning:* Functions, user input, conditional logic, and error handling.

---

### 2. Drink water.py
A script that reminds you to drink water at intervals.  
It can be extended to run in the background as a health utility.

👉 *Learning:* Using **time modules**, loops, and alerts in Python.

---

### 3. Fibonacci.py
Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number or length.

👉 *Learning:* Loops, recursion, mathematical logic, and efficiency of algorithms.

---

### 4. Greeting Voice.py
A small script that greets the user with a **voice output**.  
Makes use of text-to-speech functionality.

👉 *Learning:* External libraries for speech synthesis and working with system audio.

---

### 5. Secret code.py
A program that encodes and decodes secret messages.  
Can be useful for basic encryption practice.

👉 *Learning:* String manipulation, dictionaries, and conditional logic.

---

### 6. Python.ipynb
A **Jupyter Notebook** that documents experiments, explanations, and learning notes while working on Python basics and these projects.

👉 *Learning:* Markdown, interactive Python coding, and documenting code properly.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-mini-projects.git
   cd python-mini-projects
   ```

2. Run any script:
   ```bash
   python Calculator.py
   ```

3. For Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Python.ipynb
   ```

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I learned:
- How to write modular Python scripts.
- Using **loops, conditionals, and functions** effectively.
- Handling **user input and errors**.
- Basics of **recursion** and mathematical logic.
- Introduction to **external libraries** like text-to-speech.
- How to document projects with Jupyter Notebook and README files.

---

## 📌 Next Steps
- Expand these into bigger projects (GUI calculator, encrypted chat app, etc.).
- Apply the same concepts in real-world applications.
- Explore advanced Python topics: OOP, data analysis, and machine learning.

✨ This repository marks an important milestone in my **Python learning journey**.  
It's a mix of logic, creativity, and hands-on coding practice.
